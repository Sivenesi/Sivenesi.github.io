My interests lie in the fields of Developmental and Social Psychology. I am interested in how individuals navigate social interactions with individuals who have different experiences and frameworks to them. I am motivated to understand how individuals' worldview shapes their perceptions of others and social interactions. I am also interested in how historically entrenched structural factors shape child development.  

![UCM Fog](/images/UCM_View.png){: .align-right width="200px"} I am currently a Ph.D Candidate in Developmental Psychology at the University of California, Merced. I am a member of the Interpersonal Development Lab. My dissertation work is on emotions and social interactions. Specifically, I am interested in how individuals help others navigate cultural differences in emotion norms (i.e., "Emotion Brokering"). 



I have a Bachelor of Social Sciences (Honors) in Psychology and a Masters in Neuropsychology from the University of Cape Town (UCT). My Masters work focused on intergroup empathic biases in emotions. Prior to starting my Ph.D, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Developmental Division at the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, UCT. I was involved in research that examines how early risk factors (e.g., prenatal alcohol exposure) impacts early brain development. These previous experiences shaped my interests and framework as a researcher.
