My interests lie in the fields of Developmental and Social Psychology with focus on social and emotional development in contexts of diversity and social inequality. I am particularly interested in (1) the processes by which youth navigate complex social interactions, and (2) the impact of navigating these social dynamics on youth well-being and adjustment. Overall, I seek to understand socioemotional development in our multicultural, yet oftentimes socially divided world. 

I joined Virginia Commonwealth University as a postdoctoral fellow in Fall 2025. I completed my Ph.D in Developmental Psychology at the University of California, Merced in May 2025, where I was a member of the [Interpersonal Development Lab](https://idlab.ucmerced.edu).

I have a Bachelor of Social Sciences in Psychology and isiXhosa and a Masters in Neuropsychology from the University of Cape Town (UCT). My Masters work focused on intergroup empathic biases in emotions. Prior to starting my Ph.D, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Developmental Division at the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, UCT. I worked on [research](https://bmjpaedsopen.bmj.com/content/bmjpo/2/1/e000282.full.pdf) that examines how early risk factors (e.g., prenatal alcohol exposure) impact early brain development. These previous experiences shaped my interests and framework as a researcher.
