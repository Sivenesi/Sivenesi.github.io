My research agenda stems from two broader interests of mine. First, I am interested in how individuals navigate social interactions with individuals who have different experiences and frameworks to them. Second, I am interested in how the early environment shapes development. 

I am currently a Ph.D Candidate in Developmental Psychology at the University of California, Merced. My dissertation work is on emotions and social interactions. Specifically, I am interested in how individuals help other navigate cultural differences in emotion norms (i.e., "Emotion Brokering"). 

I trained as a Neuropsychologist at the University of Cape Town. Prior to starting my Ph.D I worked as a Research Assistant in the Department of Pediatric and Child Health. I joined a project that examined how early risk factors influence early brain development.
