My research identity stems from two broad interests. First, I am interested in how individuals navigate social interactions with individuals who have different experiences and frameworks to them. Second, I am interested in how structural inequalities can manifest in development.

I am currently a Ph.D Candidate in Developmental Psychology at the University of California, Merced. I am a member of the Interpesonal Development Lab. My dissertation work is on emotions and social interactions. Specifically, I am interested in how individuals help others navigate cultural differences in emotion norms (i.e., "Emotion Brokering"). 

I have a Bachelor of Social Sciences (Honors) in Psychology and a Masters in Neuropsychology from the University of Cape Town (UCT). Prior to starting my Ph.D, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Developmental Division at the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, UCT. I was involved in research that examines how early risk factors (e.g., prenatal alcohol exposure) impacts early brain development.
