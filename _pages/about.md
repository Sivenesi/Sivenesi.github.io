My interests lie in the fields of Developmental and Social Psychology. Broadly, I am interested in how people interact with social partners with different worldviews and emotions. I am particularly interested in how children and youth (a) navigate a multicultural world and (b) facilitating others' social interactions. In addition, I am interested in how historically entrenched structural factors inform  development. Overall, I seek to explore how individuals navigate our current multicultural, yet oftentimes socially divided world.

I am currently a Ph.D Candidate in Developmental Psychology at the University of California, Merced. I am a member of the [Interpersonal Development Lab](https://idlab.ucmerced.edu). My dissertation work is on emotions and social interactions. Specifically, I am interested in how individuals help others navigate cultural differences in emotion norms (i.e., ["Emotion Brokering"](https://sivenesi.github.io/research/)).

I have a Bachelor of Social Sciences in Psychology and isiXhosa and a Masters in Neuropsychology from the University of Cape Town (UCT). My Masters work focused on intergroup empathic biases in emotions. Prior to starting my Ph.D, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Developmental Division at the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, UCT. I worked on [research](https://bmjpaedsopen.bmj.com/content/bmjpo/2/1/e000282.full.pdf) that examines how early risk factors (e.g., prenatal alcohol exposure) impact early brain development. These previous experiences shaped my interests and framework as a researcher.
