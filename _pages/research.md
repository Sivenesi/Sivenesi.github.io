![Talking](/images/Talking.png){: .align-right width="400px"} My dissertation focuses on the process of helping others navigate the different emotion norms, emotion brokering. I'm specifically interested in how youth from immigrant families interpret others' emotions for their family members. For example, consider a scenario where a parent has a heated discussion with a neighbor. The child explains to the parent that the neighbor is embarrassed as they realize that they are at fault, rather than angry, as the parent assumes. 
I propose that emotion brokering is a novel and distinct form of cultural brokering (i.e., the process of interpreting cultural norms for others).


 I am exploring a number of questions related to the topic of emotion brokering. Including: 

**Emotion Brokering Experience**
-   I have examined the experience of emotion brokering among youth from immigrant families. Specifically, I have researched the contexts and emotions involved in the emotion brokering experience. Qualitative evidence suggests that emotion brokering is distinct from other forms of cultural brokering (e.g., language brokering).
-   I am currently investigating emotion brokering from a developmental perspective. I am using an experimental paradigm to investigate 4-8-year-olds' teaching of novel emotions to others.
-   This line of research contributes to our understanding of how cultural variation in emotions manifest in daily life. In addition, the experimental work provides an ecologically valid method to investigate the development of perspective-taking and false belief understanding.

**Cultural Brokering and Psychological Adjustment**
- Growing evidence indicates that youths' assistance to their family (e.g., through cultural brokering) contributes to their psychological adjustment and wellbeing.I have explored the relationship between emotions experienced when emotion brokering and psychological adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms, acculturative stress). Findings indicate that emotion brokering has distinct associations with psychological adjustment. In addition, youths' emotions and cultural values play a role in extent to which emotion brokering predicts psychological adjustment.
- I have currently investigated how emotion brokering relates to depressive symptoms and acculturative stress. I am currently building on this line of research by examine how emotion brokering relates to other aspects of well-being (i.e., parental relationship quality). In addition, I am investigating emotion brokering in a different cultural context (i.e., South Africa).
- My goal is to deepen the understanding of how youths' experiences helping others navigate social interactions impacts their well-being. This work is particularly significant for minoritized populations who demonstrate unique profiles of resilience and adaptability, but are also often vulnerable to poor psychological well-being.
